# ✋Hand-Gesture Controlled Flappy Bird

A computer-vision powered Flappy Bird clone where your hand controls the bird using yout webcam...because i thought its a fun side hustle😝

Raise your hand → bird flies
Lower your hand → gravity takes over

No keyboard required (except spacebar to restart).

## 🎮 Demo

Gesture-controlled gameplay built using:

- OpenCV (for webcam capture)
- MediaPipe (for hand tracking and placement..either "hand up" or "hand down")
- Pygame (acts as the game engine)

This project combines real-time computer vision with interactive game physics.
